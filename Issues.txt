- Interpreting a Tidal Statement.

    I would like to be able to receive a statement from a browser form/textbox
    and interpret it using the tidal interpreter.

    From what I understand there are two methods of doing this.
        - Through a pipeline
        - Through native code?
        
    However I am unsure how to do either using reflex. I had previously been
    looking into the second option so I will look into the first.
    
    Here is the Reflex.Dom quick reference:

    Is there anything here that might help?
