projectional editing platform for Tidal

We think the steps are like this, but make no guarantees:

1. install stack on your system. If you use homebrew, then this works:
```
brew install haskell-stack
```


You can build ghcjs with the stack.yaml in this folder.

To install reflex

cd try-stack-reflex
./try-stack-reflex

This will run a script and install reflex. If you have any trouble here is the link to the source of the script.
