# estuary

projectional editing platform for Tidal

We think the steps are like this, but make no guarantees:

1. install stack on your system. If you use homebrew, then this works:
```
brew install haskell-stack
```

2. run stack setup from the top level of the estuary folder to setup an independent ghc installation and ghcjs. This will probably take a very long time:
```
cd estuary
stack setup
```

3. 

To install reflex

cd try-stack-reflex
./try-stack-reflex

This will run a script and install reflex. If you have any trouble here is the link to the source of the script.
